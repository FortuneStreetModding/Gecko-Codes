# Fortune Street & Boom Street Gecko Codes
Up-to-date Gecko Codes for Fortune Street and Boom Street. We recommend using these codes instead of the ones hosted on Gamehacking.org, since many of those codes are out-of-date and have various issues.

#### Installation

You can either add the codes you want individually by adding them through Dolphin's Gecko Codes menu, or you can download the files directly and install them all at once by replacing your Dolphin ini file. Please note that replacing these files will overwrite any of your individual game settings for that game ID in your copy of Dolphin.

To Download, right click the appropriate link above and click "Save Linked Content as".

To Install, add these to your Dolphin GameSettings directory. By default it should be: %appdata%/Dolphin Emulator/GameSettings

Make sure you have Enable Cheats checked in Dolphin under Config.

The filenames correspond to the three Game IDs:

ST7E01 = Fortune Street

ST7P01 = Boom Street

ST7JGD = Itadaki Street Wii

If you have a modified version of Fortune Street or Boom Street, you may need to rename the file to the modified Game ID. You can check the Game ID of your game in Dolphin by right clicking on the game and clicking Properties > Info.

By default, CSMM-modified games like Custom Street World Tour have the respective IDs of ST7E02 and ST7P02.

You can then access the codes in Dolphin by right-clicking the game in properties, and clicking the Gecko Codes tab. Feel free to check or uncheck the codes as you please.

These codes can also be used on Wii, but we can't provide detailed installation instructions for that as the method required will vary depending on the software you use.

If you have any codes you'd like to add, let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DE9Hn7T).
