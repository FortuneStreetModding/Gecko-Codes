# Fortune Street & Boom Street Gecko Codes
Up-to-date Gecko Codes for Fortune Street and Boom Street. We recommend using these codes instead of the ones hosted on Gamehacking.org.

### [Fortune Street Gecko Codes](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/Gecko-Codes/blob/main/ST7E01.ini)

### [Boom Street Gecko Codes](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/Gecko-Codes/blob/main/ST7P01.ini)

#### Installation

You can either add the codes you want to install individually by adding codes through Dolphin, or you can download the ini files directly and installing them into your Dolphin folder.

To download, right click the above links and click Save Linked Content.

To install, add these to your Dolphin GameSettings directory. By default: User/Documents/Dolphin Emulator/GameSettings

The filenames correspond to the Game IDs:

ST7E01 = Fortune Street
ST7P01 = Boom Street

If you have a modified version of Fortune Street or Boom Street, you may need to rename the file to the modified Game ID. You can check the Game ID of your game in Dolphin by right clicking on the game and clicking Properties > Info.
