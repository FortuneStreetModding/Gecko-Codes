# Fortune Street & Boom Street Gecko Codes
Up-to-date Gecko Codes for Fortune Street and Boom Street. We recommend using these codes instead of the ones hosted on Gamehacking.org.

### [Fortune Street Gecko Codes](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/Gecko-Codes/blob/main/ST7E01.ini)

### [Boom Street Gecko Codes](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/Gecko-Codes/blob/main/ST7P01.ini)

#### Installation

You can either add the codes you want individually by adding them through Dolphin's Gecko Codes menu, or you can download the files directly and install them all at once. Please note that doing so will overwrite any of your individual game settings in Dolphin.

To Download, right click the above links and click Save Linked Content as.

To Install, add these to your Dolphin GameSettings directory. By default: User/Documents/Dolphin Emulator/GameSettings

Make sure you have Enable Cheats checked in Dolphin under Config.

The filenames correspond to the Game IDs:

ST7E01 = Fortune Street

ST7P01 = Boom Street

If you have a modified version of Fortune Street or Boom Street, you may need to rename the file to the modified Game ID. You can check the Game ID of your game in Dolphin by right clicking on the game and clicking Properties > Info.

If you have any codes you'd like to add, let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DE9Hn7T).
