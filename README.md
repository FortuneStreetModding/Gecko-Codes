# Gecko-Codes
Up-to-date Gecko Codes for Fortune Street and Boom Street. We recommend using these codes instead of the ones hosted on Gamehacking.org.

To use, add these to your Dolphin GameSettings directory. By default, User/Documents/Dolphin Emulator/GameSettings

The filenames correspond to the Game IDs.

ST7E01 = Fortune Street
ST7P01 = Boom Street

If you have a modified version of Fortune Street or Boom Street, you will need to rename the file to the modified Game ID. You can check the Game ID of your game in Dolphin if you're not sure.
