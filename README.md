### Installation

To use, add these to your Dolphin GameSettings directory. By default: User/Documents/Dolphin Emulator/GameSettings

The filenames correspond to the Game IDs.

ST7E01 = Fortune Street
ST7P01 = Boom Street

If you have a modified version of Fortune Street or Boom Street, you will need to rename the file to the modified Game ID. You can check the Game ID of your game in Dolphin by right clicking on the game and clicking Properties > Info.

Please note that installing these will overwrite your settings enabled for the game.
